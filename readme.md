# ONCE: Boosting Content-based Recommendation with Both Open- and Closed-source Large Language Models

We use OpenAI GPT3.5 as closed-source LLM in this work. 
This repo only contains request codes for the ONCE framework.

- LLM as content summarizer: news_summarizer.py and book_summarizer.py
- LLM as user profiler: user_profiler.py and user_profiler_goodreads.py
- LLM as personalized content generator: personalized_news_generator.py and personalized_book_generator.py
- Chain-based Generation: chain-based.py
